Copywriter  
Location: New York, NY

Job Description

Vimeo is growing like a magical beanstalk and the word department needs some help. If you find yourself chuckling at other people's malapropisms, sneaking off to the bathroom to read Ulysses Annotated, and/or writing punchy headlines to describe mundane moments in your life ("Elevator Conversation Expertly Avoided"), we would like to hear from you. Actually, there is no audio component to the job application, so "hear from you" is a bit inaccurate. But you already knew that.

What You'll Do:
- Play a lead role in concepting and creating all manner of written deliverables for Vimeo: from product pages to blog posts to banner ads to postcards to temporary tattoos. And the occasional permanent tattoo.
- Help develop promotional messaging strategies for individual projects, plus think big and conceive campaign-level ideas to help us solve business challenges (preferably without using embarrassing jargon like "business challenges").
- Help oversee and obsess about the consistency and quality of our brand voice and make sure we always sound like us.
- Proactively scour Vimeo.com and continuously edit and improve existing copy.
- Partner with cool people on different teams from all around the company: design, community, sales, marketing, HR, PR, business development, and sometimes even straight-up development.
- Bring chill positive vibes to our office.

Skills & Knowledge You Should Possess:
- A total badass mastery of the English language.
- A minimum of 3 years of related experience. Preferably some experience working on an Internet product or service, or a great enthusiasm for creating beautiful Internet products / services.
- The desire to quickly adapt and sometimes fly by the seat of your jean shorts in order to help us grow a brand that is rapidly evolving.
- Huge brains, astounding mental flexibility, and rapier wit.
- The verbal skills of the most articulate Wu-Tang member and the ability to communicate your ideas clearly and concisely. And with mad style, son!
- Stellar copyediting, proofreading, and copy-enhancing chops, the last being the ability to take anything from raw material to nearly finished text and turn it into a great idea and/or a polished piece.
- The intestinal fortitude to say "no" to things you don't believe in, or things that don't meet our brand/voice guidelines.
- An uncontrollable desire to make sentences shorter and funnier.
- A willingness to participate in brainstorming sessions, design reviews, meetings with partners, and lunches on the High Line.
- Plenty of marketing smarts, but also a healthy skepticism of marketing.
- The knowhow to put together a copy deck that designers and other humans can understand.
- A portfolio of ad copy, brand copy, UX/instructional copy, and maybe even some editorial flimflammery.
- The ability to explain the difference between i.e. and e.g. (yes, there will be a quiz).
- To apply, please send us these things:

Your nasty (in a good way) resume
- non-generic cover letter
- link to your portfolio or blog or whatever digital repository you use to stockpile accomplishments
- short list of cherished malapropisms
- sample Vimeo blog post that touches on three things: the value of Vimeo Plus; one recent Internet meme of your choosing; and pizza.

A little about us:  
Vimeo is the high-quality video platform for creative people around the world. Vimeo was founded in 2004 by filmmakers who wanted a fun and easy way to share their work and moments from their lives. We remain true to that mission by continually striving to help people with a wide range of passions share the things they create and care about. Today, Vimeo reaches a monthly audience of over 90 million creators and viewers â€” and we're growing bigger every day. Vimeo is made with love by a highly ambitious, ridiculously innovative, and certifiably hilarious team based in New York City, and we'd love for you to be a part of it.
